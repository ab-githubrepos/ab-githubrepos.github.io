# Generic CNAME file template

# Comments start with a pound sign (#) and are ignored by the DNS resolver.
# You can use comments to document the purpose of each record.

# Example CNAME record:
# alias.example.com.     IN      CNAME       target.example.com.
# ^                      ^        ^           ^
# Alias domain           TTL      Record type Target domain

# Replace the placeholders with actual domain names and values.

# CNAME record 1:
# Replace "alias1.example.com" with the alias domain name.
# Replace "target1.example.com" with the target domain name.
alias1.example.com.     IN      CNAME       target1.example.com.

# CNAME record 2:
# Replace "alias2.example.com" with the alias domain name.
# Replace "target2.example.com" with the target domain name.
alias2.example.com.     IN      CNAME       target2.example.com.

# Add more CNAME records as needed...
